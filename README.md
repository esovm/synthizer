# Synthizer
A simple experimental language for real time additive audio synthesis, intended for the creation of unique mathematical sounds.

## What works so far
- Lexing
- Parsing
- Typechecking
- Codegen (LLVM backend)
- Audio output (WAV)
- Real time audio output

## Todo
- Documentation
- GPU backend
- GUI
- MIDI (maybe) or at least some interface for a DAW
- Graphical representations of the sound

## Example code
A wide variety of unit tests can be found in the tests directory.
Actual sound producing examples coming soon!
