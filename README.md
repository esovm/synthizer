# Synthizer
A simple, experimental functional language for real time additive audio synthesis specialized for the creation of unique mathematical sounds.

## What works so far
- Lexing
- Parsing the language into an AST

## Todo
- Interpret the language
- Optimization
- Audio output
- GUI
- Real time audio output
- MIDI (maybe) or at least some interface for a DAW
- Graphical representations of the sound

## Example code
See the examples directory. Syntax is subject to change at any moment and will not be documented fully until it has stabilized.
