{"name":"Synthizer","tagline":"An experimental functional language for real time additive audio synthesis.","body":"Synthizer is a language for [additive audio synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis) inspired by the [Context Free Art](http://www.contextfreeart.org/) project, which is used in a similar manner to produce visual art. It harnesses the idea of **recursive audio synthesis** to create many unusual and unique sounds.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nAt the moment, this is very experimental software and getting it to work on your machine may take some work. Binaries are not currently provided, so you will need to compile it yourself. There are two major dependencies:\r\n* [Rust (Nightly)](http://rust-lang.org/)\r\n* [LLVM](http://llvm.org/)\r\n\r\nHowever, the only runtime dependency at the moment is [LLVM](http://llvm.org/).\r\nFor Windows users, you may need to install Visual Studio 2013 or newer, though Windows is currently untested. If you manage to get Synthizer running on Windows, please let me know!\r\n\r\nOnce you have those installed, clone this repository, run ```cargo build --release``` and you're ready to go! The binary can be found at ```target/release/synthizer```.\r\n\r\nCheck out the examples directory some example synths. You can stream them in real time using ```synthizer stream FILENAME.synt``` or write a WAV file with ```synthizer write -l LENGTH_IN_SECONDS FILENAME.synt OUTPUT.wav```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
